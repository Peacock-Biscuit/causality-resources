## Introduction

Causal inference allows us to understand cause-and-effect relationships rather than just correlations. In fields like economics, healthcare, and public policy, this understanding is essential for making informed decisions, allocating resources effectively, and achieving desired outcomes. Without causal inference, strategies could be based on assumptions rather than evidence, potentially leading to wasted efforts and unintended consequences.
